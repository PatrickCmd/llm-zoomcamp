The war came after Huayna Capac's death in 1527, and lasted from 1529 until 1532. When their father died, the empire was divided between the two brothers. Hu\\u00e1scar got most part of it, with the capital Cusco. Atahualpa got the northern parts, including Quito. Hu\\u00e1scar started the war because he saw himself as the rightful heir to the kingdom. Atahualpa proved to be a better war tactician than his brother, and commanded a much bigger army.MacQuarrie, The Last Days, p. 50. The empire was reunited under Atahualpa in 1532, but he was executed by the Spanish less than a year later. It was partly because of this civil war that the Spanish conquistadors, under Francisco Pizarro, were successful. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources *Hemming, John. The Conquest of the Inca.

Anarchists think there should be no government. * Conservatism thinks that the current institutions and organisation are a result of culture. It thinks that the concepts that are there are not bad, and that new structures and ideas should build on them. * Socialism and Communism think that the working class has been exploited. According to Karl Marx personal liberty has been exchanged for the exchange of goods and services. * Nationalism tries to put the own people first. One's own people should have the right to not be oppressed. * In Totalitarianism, there's one leader (or a very small group of people) who determines what is good for the people. == Related pages == * Internet censorship Category:Community Category:Human rights Category:Law Category:Liberalism Category:Political philosophy Category:Rights\", \"x\": 4.63303279876709, \"y\": 6.846197128295898}, {\"title\": \"Seneschal\", \"text\": \"A seneschal was an officer in the houses of important nobles in the Middle Ages.

These are popular among tourists, with 30% of tourists visiting at least one national park during their stay in New Zealand. While the national parks contain some of New Zealand's most beautiful scenery, the first few that were created were all focused on mountains. Since the 1980s more different kinds of New Zealand landscapes have been included in the national parks. New Zealand's national parks are all important to preserve both nature and culture, and some are also historically important. Tongariro National Park is one of 27 World Heritage Sites that is of both cultural and natural significance, and four of the South Island national parks form Te Wahipounamu, another World Heritage Site. == National Parks Act == The National Parks Act of 1980 was written to record what national parks are for, and how they would be chosen and looked after. It begins by explaining what a national park is: The National Parks Act goes on to say that the public will be allowed to enter and use the parks freely, but with rules to avoid destroying the native plants and animals or the parks. Access to specially protected areas (550 km\\u00b2) as noted under the act is only allowed with special permits. National parks are soil, water and forest conservation areas, and should be kept as natural as possible. Native plants and animals are to be looked after and other plants and animals removed if they harm the natural wildlife. Development in what the act calls \\\"wilderness areas\\\" is only foot tracks and huts used for wild animal control or scientific research. ===Services available for public use=== The Act allows the Department of Conservation to provide hostels, huts, camping grounds, ski tows and other services, parking areas, roading and tracks within the parks. As well as these, the department also provides some accommodation, transport and other services at entry points to the parks, but these are also offered by others. Other services within the parks, such as guided walks and skiing tutorials, are provided by other companies, sometimes with help from the department. ==List of national parks== National Park Area Established Location Description Te Urewera National Park 2127 km\\u00b2 1954 When put together with Whirinaki Forest Park, Te Urewera is the largest remaining stand of native forest in the North Island. Tongariro National Park* 796 km\\u00b2 1887 Tongariro National Park is New Zealand's first national park, recognised as one of the 27 World Heritage Sites that are of both outstanding natural and cultural value. It was given to the government by Te Heuheu T\\u016bkino IV and includes several sacred M\\u0101ori sites and three active volcanoes, Ruapehu, Ngauruhoe and Tongariro. Egmont National Park 335 km\\u00b2 1900 This park contains the land about a nine-kilometre radius of Mount Taranaki/Egmont and some areas to the north. Whanganui National Park 742 km\\u00b2 1986 This park borders the Whanganui River and contains areas of Crown land, former state forest and a number of former reserves. Abel Tasman National Park 225 km\\u00b2 1942 The smallest national park, this popular tourist destination has many tidal inlets and beaches of golden sand along the shores of Tasman Bay. \\\"Doing the Abel Tasman\\\" as a tramping or kayaking journey is a popular activity. Kahurangi National Park 4,520 km\\u00b2 1996 Kahurangi is New Zealand's second largest national park, and is located on the north-west of the South Island. It contains ancient landforms and unique flora and fauna, as well as tracks like the well-used Heaphy Track. Nelson Lakes National Park 1,018 km\\u00b2 1956 Nelson Lakes National Park stretches south from the forest on the shores of Lake Rotoiti and Rotoroa to the Lewis Pass National Reserve. It is a rugged mountain area. Paparoa National Park 306 km\\u00b2 1987 Paparoa is on the West Coast of the South Island between Westport and Greymouth. It includes the famous Pancake Rocks at Punakaiki. Arthur's Pass National Park 1,144 km\\u00b2 1929 This park is located on the main divide of the Southern Alps and has very rugged mountain terrain. Westland Tai Poutini National Park* 1,175 km\\u00b2 1960 Extends from the highest peaks of the Southern Alps to a wild remote coastline. Included in the park are glaciers, scenic lakes and dense rainforest, as well as the remains of old gold mining towns along the coast. Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park* 707 km\\u00b2 1953 An alpine park, containing New Zealand's highest mountain, Aoraki/Mount Cook (3,754 m) and its longest glacier, Tasman Glacier (29 km). A popular place for mountaineering, ski touring and scenic flights, the park is an area of outstanding natural beauty. Mount Aspiring National Park* 3,555 km\\u00b2 1964 A complex of impressively glaciated mountain scenery centred on Mount Aspiring/Tititea (3,030 m),NHK, \\\"Aspiring: Glistening Peak Forged by Wind and Water -- New Zealand, 3,030 m\\\"; retrieved 2012-5-24. New Zealand's highest peak outside of the main divide. Fiordland National Park* 12,519 km\\u00b2 1952 The largest national park in New Zealand and one of the largest in the world, the park covers the southwest corner of the South Island. The grandeur of its scenery, with its deep fiords, its glacial lakes, its mountains and waterfalls, make it a popular tourist destination. Rakiura National Park 1,500 km\\u00b2 2002 Covering about 85% of Stewart Island/Rakiura, this is the newest of the national parks. ==Proposed national park== The area around Waipoua Forest, north of Dargaville, was suggested to become a new Kauri National Park. The area contains most of New Zealand's remaining kauri, including the largest known kauri, T\\u0101ne Mahuta. These stands of kauri are also important because they are homes for many endangered species including the North Island brown kiwi. This proposal is currently being considered by the Department of Conservation. ==Mining concerns == In 2010 the New Zealand Government proposed removing some national park and conservation areas from Schedule 4 protection of the Crown Minerals Act which means that mining is not allowed in those areas. In July the government decided against the proposal after receiving a large number of submissions, most of which were against mining. ==References== ==Other websites== *National Park information at the Department of Conservation New Zealand New Zealand Category:Geography of New Zealand Category:Lists of national parks national parks\", \"x\": 2.879106044769287, \"y\": 8.330659866333008}, {\"title\": \"Charles Hard Townes\", \"text\": \"Charles Hard Townes (July 28, 1915 - January 27, 2015) was an American Nobel Prize-winning physicist and educator.

Plays often show conversations between people. A play is usually watched, rather than being read. The people who appear in a play are actors; in a theatre they stand on a stage so the people watching (the audience) can see them better. A director helps the actors to work better, or tells them how he wants the play to be. Plays can be very interesting because they can be understood in many different ways. When the writer - the playwright - makes the play, he can not say how the actors or director will use it. Sometimes the playwright is also the director or an actor: Moli\\u00e8re, for example, was often an actor in his plays. But the director can change the play in different ways: the actors' costume, the music, how people say things, how they move or what they hold. Modern directors can direct plays by Shakespeare, and these old plays seem modern now, too. There are many sorts of plays, but there are six important sorts: #Tragedy - the end is sad, because of bad luck, because the hero is not perfect, or because of the gods. #Comedy - the end is happy. Some things in this sort of play are funny; it makes us laugh. #Domestic drama - the play is about normal life, family and friends. #Tragicomedy - this play is both a tragedy and a comedy. #Melodrama - this sort of play often has a happy ending. In it there is a villain - a bad person - but the hero (and often a heroine) win. The emotions are very strong. #Symbolic - this sort of play is about ideas. The people in the play are not so important. Symbolic can also be called expressionistic. Its all about how the writer or director presents ideas in a very different point of view. #(Experimental) - this is a play in which the director and actors can try out new ideas. Anything can be tried out. It is an experiment. == Related pages == *Drama *Intermission *Improvisation\", \"x\": 4.2220234870910645, \"y\": 6.532586574554443}, {\"title\": \"Barun, India\", \"text\": \"Barun is a small town in Bihar in the District Aurangabad.

Though Nola is attracted to the best in each of them, she refuses to commit to any of them. Instead, she likes her personal freedom. Her carefree, sexual lifestyle comes to an end when the three men meet and talk about Nola. Greer justifies Nola's arrogant behavior by saying she doesn't see the three as individuals. She sees the three as a group. Jamie and Mars become unhappy over how little Nola cares for all three men. Jamie realizes that Greer and Mars are too scared of losing Nola to force her to choose one of them. Jamie tells Nola she must choose a single lover. Nola asks Jamie to come to her apartment to have casual sex. Jamie rapes Nola. He mockingly asks her if he's as good sexually as Greer or Mars. Nola has a \\\"no-sex\\\" agreement.

The key idea is based on the two wrongs phrase which consider the two things as wrong. \\u201cTwo wrongs don't make a right\\u201d, is a proverb used to rebuke or renounce wrongful conduct as a response to another's assumed transgression. \\u201cTwo wrongs make a right\\u201d in which an allegation of wrongdoing is countered with a similar allegation. In English language, it might be considered as a fallacy of relevance. ==\\u201cTwo wrongs make a right\\u201d== \\u201cTwo wrongs make a right\\u201d might be considered as a fallacy of relevance when assuming that, if one wrong is committed, then another wrong will cancel it out. This phrase considers the two actions are wrong. for this reason it is not used by a wrongdoer which does not consider its action as wrong. This phrase considers breaking the law (or the wrong) is justified, as long as the other party also does so. == Two wrongs do not make one right == Two wrongs don't make a right is a proverb which means that a wrongful action is not a appropriate way to correct or cancel a previous wrongful action, in regard to a norm. Additionally, it alleges the first action is also wrong. == Relationship == When both actions are considered wrong, the two phrases might be opposed to each other. ==Criticism== Common use of the term has been criticized by scholar Gregory S. Kavka writing in the Journal of Business Ethics. Kavka refers back to philosophical concepts of retribution by Thomas Hobbes. He states that if something supposedly held up as a moral standard or common social rule is violated enough in society, then an individual or group within society can break that standard or rule as well since this keeps them from being unfairly disadvantaged. As well, in specific circumstances violations of social rules can be defensible if done as direct responses to other violations. For example, Kavka states that it is wrong to deprive someone of their property but it is right to take property back from a criminal who takes other's property in the first place. He also states that one should be careful not to use this ambiguity as an excuse to recklessly violate ethical rules. Conservative journalist Victor Lasky wrote in his book It Didn't Start With Watergate that while \\\"two wrongs don't make a right\\\", if a set of immoral things are done and left un-prosecuted, this creates a legal precedent. Thus, people who do the same wrongs in the future should rationally expect to get away as well. Lasky analogizes the situation between John F. Kennedy's wiretapping of Martin Luther King, Jr. (which lead to nothing) and Richard Nixon's actions in Watergate (which Nixon thought would also lead to nothing).It Didn't Start With Watergate.

Unlike the pitcher in a game of baseball, a bowler delivers with a straight arm (see photo). A ball bowled with the elbow bent is a throw, and that is illegal. If the bowler bowls while not in the right part of the nonstriker's ground,https://www.lords.org/mcc/the-laws-of-cricket/no-ball The bowler must bowl behind the popping crease, which is where one of the batsmen's grounds is, and within the return creases. or bowls the ball out of the reach of the striking batter, that is also illegal. Illegal bowling gives the batting team 1 point, mostly can't get players out, and doesn't count toward the limit on the number of deliveries in the game. A bowler who can also bat well, is called an all rounder. There are different types of bowler, and a cricket team will usually have a mix of different types. == Fast bowler == A fast bowler uses simple speed to defeat a batsman. They can send the ball to the batsman at a speed of 145 km/h. They take a long run up before bowling each ball to build speed. Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan was the first to bowl at a speed of 160 km/h. Another famous fast bowler is Australian Brett Lee. == Medium pace bowler == A medium pace bowler bowls more slowly. They often use other tricks to defeat the batsman. They can get the ball able to curve in the air or change the speed or length (where the ball hits the ground) to fool the batsman. Some are very accurate so they can repeatedly send the ball to a place which forces the batsman to defend rather than scoring runs. Others grip the ball so that it lands on its seam; this makes the path of the ball unpredictable. == Spin bowler == A spin bowler usually bowls quite slowly and puts a lot of spin on the ball which makes it bounce at an angle off the ground. This makes the batsman play each ball carefully. Generally spin bowlers give up the most runs but they all have \\\"tricks\\\" that they use to fool the batsman and get him or her out. These tricks are given names such as the arm ball, googly, flipper, topspinner or doosra. Spin bowling is very much about fooling the batsman rather than speed. A fast off spin is the normal off spin action but with more pace. Off spin is when the cricket ball spins towards a right-handed batsmen's bat (bowler's left to right). With more pace, there usually is less turn (amount of spin). Off-spin is also called an off- break or finger spin. A famous spin bowler was the Australian Shane Warne, but his type was the leg break, which uses the wrist to spin the ball from the bowler's right to left. This is varied with the top spin, when the ball comes on straight and low. == References == Category:Cricket\", \"x\": 4.587303638458252, \"y\": 6.447366714477539}, {\"title\": \"Badawi Pass\", \"text\": \"The Badawi Pass connects Dir with Kohistan District in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

The Creole Townhouse in New Orleans, Louisiana is also noted for its prominent use of verandas. ==Related pages== *Awning *Canopy *Deck *Loggia *Patio *Terrace ==References== ==Other websites== *Verandah *Archnet discussion forum on Verandah *British Empire Architecture * Ajay Sinha Discovers Experimentation in Ancient Indian Temple Design *See more verandas in the Becoming Queensland online exhibition Category:Architectural elements\", \"x\": 2.5987086296081543, \"y\": 6.839556694030762}, {\"title\": \"M\\u00e4rstetten\", \"text\": \"M\\u00e4rstetten is a municipality of the district of Weinfelden in the canton of Thurgau in Switzerland. thumb|left|250px|Church of M\\u00e4rstetten ==References== Category:Municipalities in Weinfelden\", \"x\": 1.9199144840240479, \"y\": 8.588024139404297}, {\"title\": \"Henry Campbell-Bannerman\", \"text\": \"Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman GCB (7 September 1836 - 22 April 1908) was a Scottish- born British Liberal statesman.

That person has been exposed to the toxin. When a person is exposed to a toxin, many different things about that person, the toxin, and the exposure affect toxicity. Toxicity is how the person reacts to the toxin, including what symptoms they may have. A person can get exposed to a toxin accidentally or on purpose. People can also use toxins as weapons to try to kill other people (for example, during chemical or biological warfare). ==Anything can be a toxin== Anything can be a toxin if enough of it gets into a person's body. For example, even water can be toxic. If a person drinks enough water (usually more than 6 gallons in one day), they can get water toxicity (also called \\\"water poisoning\\\" or \\\"water intoxication\\\"). This causes the body's cells to swell up with extra water. Swelling in the brain's cells can cause brain damage or death. Water, in normal amounts, helps keep us alive; but if a person is exposed to enough of it, it becomes a toxin, and it can kill the person. The dose of something which is fatal in 50% of cases is measured in weight of the toxin per kg of body fat in humans. This is called the LD50. ==Types of exposure== There are two major types of exposure: acute and chronic. An acute exposure happens only one time. Chronic exposure happens many times, over a long period of time. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines these types of exposure this way:p. 105 * An acute exposure lasts 24 hours or less * A chronic exposure lasts for more than three months ==Routes of exposure== Toxins can get into the body in four different ways. These are called \\\"routes of exposure.\\\" The route of exposure is one of the many things that affects toxicity. ===Inhalation=== Toxins can get into the body through inhalation (the person breathes in the toxin). If a toxin is a gas, inhalation is usually the way it gets into the body.p. 1 When a toxin is inhaled, it may injure the airways and the lungs. Also, some toxins can go from the lungs into the bloodstream. The bloodstream then delivers blood - with the toxin in it - to all of the organs in the body. The toxin can then damage those organs.p. 1 Inhalation is one of the easiest and fastest ways for toxins to get into the body. The lining of the respiratory tract absorbs toxins into the bloodstream very quickly.p. 99 ====Examples of inhaled toxins==== An example of a commonly inhaled toxin is cigarette smoke. There are over 100 toxins in cigarette smoke, including formaldehyde, arsenic, and hydrogen cyanide. Smoking is also an example of chronic toxic exposure. The exposure is chronic because the smoker is breathing in toxins many times, over a long period of time. Another inhaled toxin that causes acute exposure is smoke from house fires. There are many toxins in this kind of smoke, including carbon monoxide and cyanide. Firefighters or people who were trapped in fires can get cyanide poisoning or carbon monoxide poisoning from breathing in these toxins. This is an example of an acute exposure, because the smoke was not breathed in for more than 24 hours. ===Absorption=== If a toxin gets in a person's eyes or on their skin, it can get taken up into the bloodstream. This is called absorption. Absorption through the skin is the most common route of toxic exposure.p. 97 The skin is able to keep some toxins from getting into the body. However, if a person has a cut or wound on their skin, any toxin will be able to get into the body through that wound. Also, the toxin will be taken up into the bloodstream more quickly, because it does not have to get absorbed through the skin.p. 98 ====Examples of absorbed toxins==== Exposure by absorption often happens in workplaces where people work with toxins. For example, if a person who works at a gas station spills gasoline on himself, the body will quickly absorb the gasoline into the bloodstream.p. 98 Some chemical weapons like sarin, a nerve gas, can also be absorbed through the skin and the eyes, along with being inhaled. ===Ingestion=== Ingestion means that a person swallowed the toxin. Some chemicals cannot get into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract. However, others are absorbed through the lining of the intestinal tract into the bloodstream.p. 100 ====Examples of ingested toxins==== Ingestion of toxins is very common in developing countries, where many people do not have safe drinking water. There are many different toxins that can be carried in water. They can be chemicals, like lead. They can also be biological toxins, like the bacteria that causes cholera, and the viruses that cause Hepatitis A and polio. People ingest these toxins by drinking the contaminated water, or eating food made with the water. The World Health Organization says that about 502,000 people die every year because of toxins in water and the diseases they cause. Toxins in water can be killed by heating them up to boil at a high enough temperature. Boiled water can be more safe to drink. Food poisoning is also caused by ingestion of toxins, like E. coli bacteria, which can live in foods like meat and poultry. ===Injection=== An injected toxin gets into the body when something carrying the toxin breaks the skin. Injections can go into a vein, a muscle, or just under the skin. Toxins that are injected into a vein have the fastest effects, because the toxin is being put right into the bloodstream.p. 2 ====Examples of injected toxins==== Some snakes, scorpions, and spiders carry venom. If they bite or sting a person, they are injecting a toxin into the body. Venom differs from toxins. For example if you bit a snake and got sick, you would be getting sick from a toxin; If a snake bites you and you get sick, it would be from venom. An example of a toxin which is often injected on purpose is Botulinum. This can cause botulism. It is also sold under the name \\\"Botox.\\\" Many people choose to get Botulinum toxin injected into their faces to get rid of wrinkles. The toxin paralyzes some of the muscles in the face, usually for three to 12 months, and makes the face look smoother. ===More than one route=== Some toxins can get into the body through more than one route of exposure. For example, if water is polluted, a person can get exposed to the toxins in the water by drinking it (ingestion) and by showering or swimming in it (absorption). ==Things that affect toxicity== Once a person has been exposed to a toxin, there are many things that affect toxicity. This article talks about only a few. ===The exposure=== Many things about a person's exposure affect toxicity. Three of the most important things are: * Concentration: How much of the toxin was the person exposed to? * Duration: How long was the person exposed to the toxin? * Frequency: How many times was the person exposed? The route of exposure also affects toxicity. For example, if it is injected, snake venom can be life-threatening. However, if it is ingested, snake venom is usually not harmful. The effects of this toxin are very different depending on the route of exposure. ===The exposed person=== Toxins sometimes affect different people in different ways. This is partly caused by differences in people's bodies. A person's age, gender, genes, hormones, nutrition, and the strength of their immune system all affect toxicity. For example, infants, young children, and the elderly are more likely to get sick from lower concentrations of toxins, which might not make a healthy adult sick. ====People with health problems==== Some health problems can affect toxicity. For example, inhaling toxins is especially dangerous for people who already have lung diseases, like emphysema. If the lungs are already damaged, breathing in toxins is likely to cause even more damage, and puts the person at risk for respiratory failure.p. 99 Also, once a toxin gets into the bloodstream, the body immediately starts trying to get rid of it through excretion. The main organs involved with excretion are the kidneys, liver, and lungs. If a person has damage to any of these organs (like kidney failure or cirrhosis of the liver), they will be unable to get rid of the toxin as fast as a healthy person will. Because of this, a toxin may shut down the liver or kidneys. The chemical will stay in their body longer, and have more toxic effects.p. 103 ===The type of toxin=== Many things about the type of toxin a person was exposed to affect toxicity. Two examples are solubility and pH. ====Solubility==== A toxin's solubility is its ability to mix into a liquid. If a toxin is not water-soluble (it cannot dissolve in water), it cannot absorb into the bloodstream. (Plasma, the liquid part of blood, is made mostly of water.) If a person ingests a toxin that cannot dissolve into the watery plasma, the toxin will not absorb into the bloodstream through the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. It will pass out of the body through the gastrointestinal tract.pp. 102\\u2013103 However, many toxins are water-soluble and will get absorbed into the bloodstream. For example, the Vibrio cholerae bacteria is water-soluble. If a person ingests water or food that has this toxin in it, they can get cholera. Other toxins are \\\"lipid-soluble\\\" (they dissolve in fats). Instead of getting absorbed into the bloodstream, these toxins get stored in the body's fat. When the person's body burns fat to make energy, these toxins are let out and can poison the person. Examples of fat- soluble toxins include lead, DDT, and mercury. ====pH==== The toxin's pH is also important. For example, if a toxin is a strong acid or a strong base, it can cause severe chemical burns to the eyes and skin.p. 100 Toxins that have a more neutral pH can still hurt the body by being absorbed into the bloodstream, but they will not burn the eyes and skin. For example, if a person swims or bathes in water contaminated with cholera toxin, the toxin can still get absorbed through his eyes or skin. However, the water will not burn the eyes or skin. ==Related pages== * Toxin * Absorption * Excretion * Solubility * pH ==References== Category:Toxicology\", \"x\": 4.606739521026611, \"y\": 7.233059406280518}, {\"title\": \"Scott Speed\", \"text\": \"Scott Andrew Speed (born January 24, 1983) is an American race car driver. He was a driver for the Toro Rosso Formula One team. He made his first F1 race start at the 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix. He was the first American to race in F1 since Michael Andretti in 1993. In 2008, Speed started racing in NASCAR. For 2009 and 2001, he drove the Red Bull Toyota Camry full time in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Speed attempted to qualify for the 2011 Indianapolis 500, but did not make the race. == Early years == Speed started kart racing at the age of 10. He moved up to Formula series in 2001. He was a champion in US Formula Russell. He drove in both the US Barber Formula Dodge and US Star Mazda Series. Speed won the 'Red Bull Driver Search' program. In 2003 he drove for the ADR team in British Formula Three. During that year he fell ill with ulcerative colitis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. He returned to the United States for treatment.Scott Speed www.formula1.com. Retrieved 1 July 2007. 2004 saw two championship titles for Speed. He won the Formula Renault 2000 Eurocup and later German Formula Renault. This was despite his worsening colitis. This performance earned him a drive in the first season of GP2 Series for 2005. He ended the season third place in the driver championship standings behind Nico Rosberg and Heikki Kovalainen. At the end of 2005, Speed drove the first three races of the new A1 Grand Prix series for A1 Team USA. == Formula One == thumb|right|Speed at the Canadian Grand Prix In 2005 at the Canadian Grand Prix, Speed took part as a test driver for Red Bull Racing; becoming the first American driver to participate in a Formula One event since Michael Andretti's 1993 stint. He was also the test driver for the United States Grand Prix. After the purchase of Minardi, Red Bull Racing announced the team would become Scuderia Toro Rosso. Speed and Vitantonio Liuzzi would be the drivers for the 2006 season. In , Speed's first race was the Bahrain Grand Prix. His best finish of the season was a ninth place at the Australian Grand Prix. He would have finished Australia in the points, but had 25 seconds added to his race time for overtaking under yellow flags. At the United States Grand Prix he qualified a career best 13th. He was taken out of the race in a first-lap collision. Scott Speed's season was disappointing. He had equipment breakdowns and several crashes. He spun off the circuit in wet conditions at the European Grand Prix. That turned out to be his last race for the team. After the race, it was reported that he was involved in a physical altercation with team principal Franz Tost. Tost has since denied this. Speed also said that they wanted to get rid of both him and Liuzzi. Before the next race at Hungary, the team announced that he had been replaced by Sebastian Vettel. == ARCA/REMAX Series == To get ready for racing in NASCAR, Speed raced in the Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) series. he enter several races in 2007, and a full season in 2008. He drove the Red Bull-sponsored Toyota for Eddie Sharp Racing. Speed finished 5th in the points in 2008. During the finale of the 2008 ARCA season, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. hit Speed and sent him into the wall. This ended Speed chance at a good finish, and possibly a Championship. After repairs, Speed intentially ran his car into Stenhouse, sending both cars into the wall. Neither driver was injured. ARCA officials parked Speed for the day. == NASCAR == Speed made his Craftsman Truck Series debut at Atlanta Motor Speedway on March 7, 2008. He drove the Morgan-Dollar Motorsports #46 Cheverolet truck with Red Bull sponsorship. In his second race, he recorded his first Top 10 finish at Martinsville Speedway. He won his first career race on May 30 at Dover with Bill Davis Racing in a Toyota. On Sunday October 19, 2008, Scott Speed started his first Sprint Cup Series event at Martinsville Speedway. He finished in 30th place. He finished the Cup season in the #84 Red Bull Toyota Camry for the Red Bull Racing Team. For the 2009 Sprint Cup season, Speed's car number was changed to #82. He won his first Rookie of the Race honor at the Daytona 500. Speed won the pole for the Sam\\u2019s Town 300 in his Nationwide Series debut on February 28, 2009. He also broke the track record with a speed of 182.45 mph and a lap time of 29.42 seconds. For the 2010 Sprint Cup season, Speed was still in the #82 car. He had a disappointing season, with only two top ten finishes. At the end of the year, Red Bull Racing release Speed from his contract. This move was to make room for the return of Brian Vickers and the addition of Kasey Kahne. Vickers was returning after heart surgery. Kahne was signed for a one-year deal. === Red Bull Racing Lawsuit === Within two weeks of leaving Red Bull Racing (RBR), Speed filed a lawsuit against the team for breach of contract. Breach of contract means that one person or group in the contract (RBR in this case) did not do the things they should have done. Speed is asking for $6.5 million US$ in the lawsuit. Speed alleges (says) that Red Bull > significantly reduced its financial commitment to Speed's race team and was > unable and/or unwilling to provide [Speed] with 'supporting equipment' > satisfactory for a driver of [his] skill to [be] effective [to] compete in > the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Speed is claiming that Red Bull did not give his race team enough money or himself good enough race cars. Without the best race cars, it is hard to race at the same level as the top teams. On July 28, 2011, Speed place a lien on RBR's property in Mooresville, North Carolina. The lien is for the race shop and the land it sits on. A lien is a legal tool to keep RBR from selling the property. The property can be used to ensure a debt is paid. RBR purchased the property for about $3.3 million US$. == IndyCar == Speed attempted to qualify for the 2011 Indianapolis 500. He drove a car entered by Dragon Racing. He was having trouble finding enough speed in the car to qualify. Dragon Racing put Patrick Carpentier in the car to test it. Carpentier spun and crashed the car. Dragon did not have another car for Speed to use. Speed was unable to qualify for the race. == Racing record == === Career summary === Season Series Team Name Races Wins Poles F/Laps Podiums Points Final Placing 2002 Formula Dodge National Championship ? 11 2 5 135 3rd Formula Mazda Doublefield Racing 4 1 2 218 18th 2003 British Formula Three Championship Alan Docking Racing 14 0 0 3 23rd 2004 Formula Renault 2000 Eurocup Motopark Academy 16 8 9 402 1st Formula Renault 2000 Germany Motopark Academy 14 4 3 293 1st Asian Formula Renault Challenge Shangsai FRD GT Tires Team 2 1 1 N/A\\u2194 NC\\u2194 2005 Formula One Red Bull Test driver Test driver Test driver Test driver Test driver Test driver Test driver GP2 Series iSport International 23 0 1 67.5 3rd 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix USA 6 0 0 23\\u2020 16th\\u2020 2006 Formula One Toro Rosso 18 0 0 0 0 0 20th 2007 Formula One Toro Rosso 10 0 0 0 0 0 21st ARCA RE/MAX Series Eddie Sharp Racing 1 0 0 195 N/A 2008 ARCA RE/MAX Series Eddie Sharp Racing 21 4 3 4925 3rd Craftsman Truck Series Bill Davis Racing 16 1 3 n/a 3 2058 21st Sprint Cup Series Red Bull Racing Team 5 0 0 n/a 0 366 55th 2009 Nationwide Series Michael Waltrip Racing 13 1 0 n/a 0 1591 34th Sprint Cup Series Red Bull Racing Team NEMCO Motorsports (2 races) 35 0 0 n/a 0 2690 35th 2010 Sprint Cup Series Red Bull Racing Team 36 0 0 n/a 0 3178 30th \\u2194 Competed in less that 75% of the races.

There are 870,000 people in Bucheon. ==History== ===Ancient=== People have lived in Bucheon for thousands of years. According to Three Kingdom Period literature, Bucheon was founded during the Goguryeo Dynasty. When Goguryeo began, Bucheon was called Jubuto (\\uc8fc\\ubd80\\ud1a0). When the Goryeo Dynasty started, the king Taejo (Wang Geon, \\uc655\\uac74) renamed Bucheon Suju (\\uc218\\uc8fc). ===Archeology=== Bucheon has a big archaeology site in the Go-Gang neighborhood (\\uace0\\uac15\\ub3d9) of Ojeong District. There are artifacts from 3,000 years ago. There are also some old gravesites there. ===Modern=== In 1962, when President Park Chung-Hee started his five-year economic development project, Sosa-myeon (\\uc18c\\uc0ac\\uba74) was renamed Bucheon City (\\ubd80\\ucc9c\\uc2dc). Bucheon's borders of today were made in 1988. Sang-Dong and Jung-Dong neighborhoods were developed as New City areas in the 1990s. ==People== Bucheon's people were farmers in the past. The population grew a lot in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, and now it is a big city. In 1985, there were 450,000 people. In 2000, there were 775,000 people. In 2013, Bucheon has 870,000 people. The average family size in Bucheon is 2.65 people. ==Districts== There are three districts (gu) in Bucheon. They are Wonmi-gu, Sosa-gu, and Ojeong-gu. In Wonmi-gu, there are 454,000 people. Most of them live in the New City areas of Jung-Dong (147,000) and Sang-Dong (117,000). In Sosa-gu, there are 222,000 people. In Ojeong-gu, there are 196,000 people. ==Culture== Bucheon calls itself a \\\"cultural city\\\". There are many museums and festivals. There are also botanical gardens. There is an orchestra, which began in 1988. ===Festivals=== Bucheon has the Bucheon International Film Festival (PiFAN) in the summer. It started in 1997 and it happens every year. The movies are comedy, romance, action, and fantasy. Bucheon also has a comic festival in the summer. ===Museums=== Bucheon has very many museums, like a robot museum, a comic museum, a history museum, and a water museum. ==Official Symbols== Bucheon had many peach orchards before it was developed as a city.
