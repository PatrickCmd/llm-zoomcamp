The editors of the Arden Shakespeare question the idea of \"source hunting\", pointing out that it presupposes that authors always require ideas from other works for their own, and suggests that no author can have an original idea or be an originator. When Shakespeare wrote there were many stories about sons avenging the murder of their fathers, and many about clever avenging sons pretending to be foolish in order to outsmart their foes. This would include the story of the ancient Roman, Lucius Junius Brutus, which Shakespeare apparently knew, as well as the story of Amleth, which was preserved in Latin by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his \"Gesta Danorum\", and printed in Paris in 1514. The Amleth story was subsequently adapted and then published in French in 1570 by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. It has a number of plot elements and major characters in common with Shakespeare\\'s \"Hamlet\", and lacks others that are found in Shakespeare. Belleforest\\'s story was first published in English in 1608, after \"Hamlet\" had been written, though it\\'s possible that Shakespeare had encountered it in the French-language version.',\n",

While Milton did not ultimately go that route, the poem still shows distinct echoes of Shakespearean revenge tragedy, and of \"Hamlet\" in particular. As scholar Christopher N. Warren argues, \"Paradise Lost\"s Satan \"undergoes a transformation in the poem from a Hamlet-like avenger into a Claudius-like usurper,\" a plot device that supports Milton\\'s larger Republican internationalist project. The poem also reworks theatrical language from \"Hamlet\", especially around the idea of \"putting on\" certain dispositions, as when Hamlet puts on \"an antic disposition,\" similarly to the Son in \"Paradise Lost\" who \"can put on / [God\\'s] terrors.\"',\n",

Anglophone merchants in Quebec were the main group supportive of the Kingston arrangement. In 1842, a vote rejected Kingston as the capital, and study of potential candidates included the then-named Bytown, but that option proved less popular than Toronto or Montreal. In 1843, a report of the Executive Council recommended Montreal as the capital as a more fortifiable location and commercial centre, however, the Governor General refused to execute a move without a parliamentary vote.

              "[{'text': 'In his 1990 book, \"Continental Divide: the Values and Institutions of the United States and Canada,\" Seymour Martin Lipset argues that the presence of the monarchy in Canada helps distinguish Canadian identity from American identity. Since at least the 1930s, supporters of the Crown have held the opinion that the Canadian monarch is also one of the rare unified elements of Canadian society, focusing both \"the historic consciousness of the nation\" and various forms of patriotism and national love \"[on] the point around which coheres the nation\\'s sense of a continuing personality\". Former Governor General Vincent Massey articulated in 1967 that the monarchy \"is part of ourselves. It is linked in a very special way with our national life. It stands for qualities and institutions which mean Canada to every one of us and which for all our differences and all our variety have kept Canada Canadian.\" But, according to Arthur Bousfield and Gary Toffoli, Canadians were, through the late 1960s to the 2000s, encouraged by the federal government to \"neglect, ignore, forget, reject, debase, suppress, even hate, and certainly treat as foreign what their parents and grandparents, whether spiritual or blood, regarded as the basis of Canadian nationhood, autonomy, and history\", including the monarchy. Former Governor General Roland Michener said in 1970 that anti-monarchists claimed the Canadian Crown is foreign and incompatible with Canada\\'s multicultural society, which the government promoted as a Canadian identifier, and Lawrence Martin called in 2007 for Canada to become a republic in order to \"re-brand the nation\". However, Michener also stated, \"[the monarchy] is our own by inheritance and choice, and contributes much to our distinctive Canadian identity and our chances of independent survival amongst the republics of North and South America.\" Journalist Christina Blizzard emphasized in 2009 that the monarchy \"made [Canada] a haven of peace and justice for immigrants from around the world\", while Michael Valpy contended in 2009 that the Crown\\'s nature permitted non-conformity amongst its subjects, thereby opening the door to multiculturalism and pluralism.',\n",

Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia but nowhere near the size of those in New Spain or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held several colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called New Netherland (now New York State.). France colonized what is now Eastern Canada, founding Quebec City in 1608. France's loss in the Seven Years' War resulted in the transfer of New France to Great Britain. The Thirteen Colonies, in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that Great Britain was imposing on the colonies. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on July 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the American Revolutionary War, Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies' independence.\",\n",

By May 9 the following year, the committee reported back with a recommendation \"that the national flag of Canada should be the Canadian red ensign with a maple leaf in autumn golden colours in a bordered background of white\". The Legislative Assembly of Quebec had urged the committee to not include any of what it deemed as \"foreign symbols\", including the Union Flag, and Mackenzie King, then still prime minister, declined to act on the report; fearing it may lead to political instability. As a result, the Union Flag was kept as a national flag, and the order to fly the Canadian Red Ensign at government buildings was maintained.',\n",

Some of those completing the seven ascents are aware of the magnitude of the challenge. In 2000, in a foreword to Steve Bell et al., \"Seven Summits\", Morrow opined \"[t]he only reason Reinhold [Messner] wasn’t the first person to complete the seven was that he was too busy gambolling up the 14 tallest mountains in the world.\"',\n",

By 2010 liquefied natural gas production had reached 77 million tons, making Qatar the richest country in the world. With fewer than two million inhabitants, the average income in the country shot to a staggering $86,440 per year per person. Qatar expert Olivier Da Lage said: \"When he came to power in 1995, Sheikh Hamad had a goal to place Qatar on the world map by exploiting the gas resources which his father did not develop for fear it would change the emirate\\'s society. Eighteen years on, he has finished the job – Qatar has acquired the financial clout to command respect from neighboring countries and Western governments alike\".In 2005, under the direction of Hamad and the former prime minister of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, the Qatar Investment Authority was established, a sovereign wealth fund to manage the country\\'s oil and natural gas surpluses.

Ross argues in \"Time Travel Paradoxes\" that in a scenario involving a physical object whose world-line or history forms a closed loop in time there can be a violation of the second law of thermodynamics. Ross uses the film \"Somewhere in Time\" as an example of such an ontological paradox, where a watch is given to a person, and 60 years later the same watch is brought back in time and given to the same character. Ross states that entropy of the watch will increase, and the watch carried back in time will be more worn with each repetition of its history. The second law of thermodynamics is understood by modern physicists to be a statistical law, so decreasing entropy and non-increasing entropy are not impossible, just improbable. Additionally, entropy statistically increases in systems which are isolated, so non-isolated systems, such as an object, that interact with the outside world, can become less worn and decrease in entropy, and it\\'s possible for an object whose world-line forms a closed loop to be always in the same condition in the same point of its history.',\n",
