This repository takes a clear, hands-on approach to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, breaking down advanced techniques into straightforward, understandable implementations. Instead of relying on frameworks like `LangChain` or `FAISS`, everything here is built using familiar Python libraries `openai`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and a few others.

The goal is simple: provide code that is readable, modifiable, and educational. By focusing on the fundamentals, this project helps demystify RAG and makes it easier to understand how it really works.

## Update: 📢
- (20-Mar-2025) Added a new notebook on RAG with Reinforcement Learning.
- (07-Mar-2025) Added 20 RAG techniques to the repository.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on a specific RAG technique.  Each notebook provides:

*   A concise explanation of the technique.
*   A step-by-step implementation from scratch.
*   Clear code examples with inline comments.
*   Evaluations and comparisons to demonstrate the technique's effectiveness.
*   Visualization to visualize the results.

Here's a glimpse of the techniques covered:

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FareedKhan-dev/all-rag-techniques.git
    cd all-rag-techniques
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up your OpenAI API key:**

    *   Obtain an API key from [Nebius AI](https://studio.nebius.com/).
    *   Set the API key as an environment variable:
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_NEBIUS_AI_API_KEY'
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        setx OPENAI_API_KEY "YOUR_NEBIUS_AI_API_KEY"  # On Windows
        ```
        or, within your Python script/notebook:

        ```python
        import os
        os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_NEBIUS_AI_API_KEY"
        ```

4.  **Run the notebooks:**

    Open any of the Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  Each notebook is self-contained and can be run independently.  The notebooks are designed to be executed sequentially within each file.

    **Note:** The `data/AI_Information.pdf` file provides a sample document for testing. You can replace it with your own PDF.  The `data/val.json` file contains sample queries and ideal answers for evaluation.
    The 'attention_is_all_you_need.pdf' is for testing Multi-Modal RAG Notebook.

## 💡 Core Concepts

*   **Embeddings:**  Numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning.  We use Nebius AI's embedding API and, in many notebooks, also the `BAAI/bge-en-icl` embedding model.

*   **Vector Store:**  A simple database to store and search embeddings.  We create our own `SimpleVectorStore` class using NumPy for efficient similarity calculations.

*   **Cosine Similarity:**  A measure of similarity between two vectors.  Higher values indicate greater similarity.

*   **Chunking:**  Dividing text into smaller, manageable pieces.  We explore various chunking strategies.

*   **Retrieval:** The process of finding the most relevant text chunks for a given query.

*   **Generation:**  Using a Large Language Model (LLM) to create a response based on the retrieved context and the user's query.  We use the `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct` model via Nebius AI's API.

*   **Evaluation:**  Assessing the quality of the RAG system's responses, often by comparing them to a reference answer or using an LLM to score relevance.
